    <h1>College Students &amp; Interviews</h1>
    <p>Internships and jobs are won or lost in interviews. Your degree gets you the interview, but your presentation, communication, and confidence get you the job. This module teaches interview fundamentals that really matter.</p>

    <h2>The Three Pillars of Interview Success</h2>
    
    <h3>Pillar 1: Appearance &amp; First Impression</h3>
    <p>Your look matters. Studies show interviewers form opinions in the first 30 seconds. Here's how to make them count.</p>

    <h4>Dress Code by Industry</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IT/Tech Companies:</strong> Business casual – formal shirt, dark pants, clean shoes</li>
      <li><strong>Finance/Banking:</strong> Formal – blazer, tie, polished shoes</li>
      <li><strong>Startups:</strong> Smart casual – nice shirt + jeans, or business casual</li>
      <li><strong>General Rule:</strong> When unsure, go formal. Better overdressed than underdressed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Grooming Essentials</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Hair clean and neatly combed</li>
      <li>Face clean (shaved or trimmed beard)</li>
      <li>Nails clean and trimmed</li>
      <li>Minimal jewelry (avoid distracting items)</li>
      <li>Shoes clean and polished</li>
      <li>Clothes ironed, no stains or wrinkles</li>
      <li>Light cologne/perfume only (not overpowering)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pillar 2: How You Speak &amp; Communicate</h3>
    <p>Your communication skill matters as much as your technical knowledge. This includes tone, pace, vocabulary, and clarity.</p>

    <h4>Speaking Tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pace:</strong> Speak slowly and clearly. Pause between sentences. Don't rush.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Loud enough to be heard. Project confidence, not arrogance.</li>
      <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Friendly and professional. No sarcasm or negativity.</li>
      <li><strong>Filler Words:</strong> Avoid "um," "like," "you know," "basically." Pause instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Use proper English. Avoid slang or regional dialects unless appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Even if unsure, speak with conviction. Say "Let me think about that" instead of stammering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Listening Skills</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen to the FULL question before answering</li>
      <li>Make notes if allowed (shows attentiveness)</li>
      <li>Ask for clarification if you don't understand</li>
      <li>Don't interrupt the interviewer</li>
      <li>Nod and show you're engaged</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pillar 3: Confidence &amp; Body Language</h3>
    <p>Confidence is half the battle. Your body language speaks louder than your words.</p>

    <h4>Body Language Checklist</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Posture:</strong> Sit upright. Lean slightly forward to show interest. Don't slouch.</li>
      <li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Look at the interviewer's eyes. Not staring, but present and engaged.</li>
      <li><strong>Handshake:</strong> Firm (not limp, not crushing). Smile. Brief eye contact.</li>
      <li><strong>Smile:</strong> Genuine smile (not fake). Shows warmth and approachability.</li>
      <li><strong>Hand Gestures:</strong> Use natural gestures to emphasize points. Avoid fidgeting.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Fidgeting:</strong> Don't tap fingers, bounce leg, or play with phone/pen</li>
      <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Sit at comfortable distance. Not too close, not too far.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Interview Questions &amp; How to Answer</h2>

    <h3>1. "Tell me about yourself"</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> A 2-3 minute summary of your background, skills, and goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Background → Key skills/achievements → Interest in this role → Where you're headed</p>
    <p><strong>Example Answer:</strong> "I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student with a passion for software development. I've built 3 projects using Python and web technologies, and I'm particularly interested in backend development and scalable systems. I'm excited about this internship because your company works on systems I admire, and I'd love to learn from experienced developers while contributing meaningful work. I'm also working on improving my system design knowledge."</p>

    <h3>2. "Why do you want to work here?"</h3>
    <p><strong>Key:</strong> Research the company. Mention specific projects, values, or culture that resonate.</p>
    <p><strong>Do NOT say:</strong> "Good pay," "Flexible timing," or generic reasons</p>
    <p><strong>Example Answer:</strong> "I'm impressed by your company's focus on innovation in AI/ML. Your recent project on [specific thing] aligns perfectly with my interest in [relevant skill]. I also appreciate your commitment to employee growth and learning, and I see this as an opportunity to develop my skills while contributing to meaningful projects."</p>

    <h3>3. "What are your strengths?"</h3>
    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Pick 2-3 real strengths. Back them with concrete examples.</p>
    <p><strong>Example Answer:</strong> "I'm a quick learner. When I started learning web development, I completed a 3-month course in 6 weeks and built a project. I'm also detail-oriented – I catch bugs others miss. In my last project, I found a memory leak that improved performance by 40%. And I communicate well – I regularly mentor juniors in my college."</p>

    <h3>4. "What are your weaknesses?"</h3>
    <p><strong>The Trick:</strong> Pick a real weakness, but show how you're improving it.</p>
    <p><strong>Example Answer:</strong> "I struggle with public speaking. But I've been actively working on it – I joined a speaking club, gave 3 presentations, and I'm getting more comfortable. I know communication is critical in teams, so I'm investing time to improve this skill."</p>

    <h3>5. "Tell me about a challenge you faced and how you solved it"</h3>
    <p><strong>Use the STAR Method:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation:</strong> What was the challenge or problem?</li>
      <li><strong>Task:</strong> What did you need to do?</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> What specific steps did you take?</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> What happened? What did you learn?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example Answer:</strong> "During a group project, one team member wasn't contributing. Situation: We had a deadline and couldn't afford delays. Task: I needed to solve this without creating conflict. Action: I talked to them privately, discovered they were struggling with the technical part, so I paired with them and taught them the concepts. Result: They contributed meaningfully, the project was successful, and I learned the importance of proactive communication."</p>

    <h3>6. "Do you have any questions for us?"</h3>
    <p><strong>ALWAYS ask questions. It shows genuine interest and curiosity.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Good Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"What does success look like in this role for the first 3 months?"</li>
      <li>"What's the team structure and who would I be working with closely?"</li>
      <li>"What technologies and tools does your team use daily?"</li>
      <li>"What are the biggest challenges your team is facing right now?"</li>
      <li>"What opportunities are there for learning and growth in this role?"</li>
      <li>"Can you tell me about the company culture and work environment?"</li>
    </ul>
