    <h1>Mentorship & Assistance</h1>
    <p>Making big career decisions is tough. That's why Akshay offers 1-on-1 mentorship to guide you through confusion, help you clarify goals, and keep you accountable.</p>

    <h2>What is Mentorship?</h2>
    <p>Mentorship is personalized guidance from someone who has walked the path. It's not one-way advice—it's a conversation where we:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand YOUR strengths, interests, and fears</li>
      <li>Explore options that match YOUR situation</li>
      <li>Build a clear, step-by-step roadmap</li>
      <li>Check in regularly and adjust the plan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You Get Through Mentorship</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Career Path Clarity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confused between streams?</strong> Get a personalized recommendation based on your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Unsure about college?</strong> Explore options aligned with your actual goals, not society's expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>Not sure if engineering is right?</strong> Test your interest before committing 4 years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Problem-Solving & Doubt Clearance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Talk through your real fears (exams, pressure, uncertainty)</li>
      <li>Get answers to questions you're hesitant to ask</li>
      <li>Understand industry perspectives on different paths</li>
      <li>Learn what successful people in your chosen field actually do</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Accountability & Progress Tracking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular check-ins to stay on track with your plan</li>
      <li>Celebrate small wins and milestones</li>
      <li>Adjust plans when circumstances change</li>
      <li>Someone who cares about your progress</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Networking & Real Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect with people working in fields you're exploring</li>
      <li>Learn industry realities (not textbook stuff)</li>
      <li>Get insider tips on college selection, exams, and job hunting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Mentorship Works</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation (30-45 mins)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Share your background, interests, and confusion</li>
      <li>Akshay listens and asks clarifying questions</li>
      <li>Understand your situation deeply</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Personalized Roadmap (1-2 weeks)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Akshay creates a custom plan based on your profile</li>
      <li>Clear next steps for the next 3-6 months</li>
      <li>Specific actions you can take immediately</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Regular Check-ins (Bi-weekly or Monthly)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Quick 30-min calls to review progress</li>
      <li>Answer new questions as they come up</li>
      <li>Adjust the plan if needed</li>
      <li>Stay motivated and on track</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Should Get Mentorship?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10th students confused about stream choice</li>
      <li>Plus Two students unsure about college/career</li>
      <li>College students feeling lost or making wrong choices</li>
      <li>Anyone who wants clarity before making a big decision</li>
      <li>People who want accountability and guidance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Makes This Different?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not theoretical:</strong> Based on real industry experience, not just books.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized:</strong> Your plan is unique to YOU, not generic advice.</li>
      <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Not just a one-time chat. Regular support through your journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest:</strong> You'll hear the truth about different paths, not motivational fluff.</li>
      <li><strong>Practical:</strong> Actionable steps you can take right now.</li>
    </ul>
